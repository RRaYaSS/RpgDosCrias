FONT NOTES:

	The number 3 (three) has been configured to show the special "C" character used as the first letter in the Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross logos.
	The number 2 (two) has been configured as a "secondary 'C'" like the one used as the "C" in the "Cross" portion of Chrono Cross.
	The number 1 (one) is a thinner version of the letter "C."

	The current version of the font is letters only, meaning that no numbers or symbols are a part of it.
